# Brief explainer of project files
## model_augmentation
### fit_systems
  - **interconnect.py** contains the code for creating the "SS_encoder_general" required for training with "deepSI"
  - **blocks.py** contains the baseline and augmentation static function blocks that are connected by the interconnect
  - **pre_encoder.py** contains the code for pre training the encoder with a dataset contain state data
### systems
This folder contains system descriptions for generating data
### utils
  - **torch_nets.py** contains code for parameterising the learning functions in augmentation blocks
  - **utils.py** contains various helper functions and plot functions
## scripts / ecc_2025
Each folder here contains scripts for generating data, estimating models, and evaluating models. For example purpose, the **journal_model_augmentation** scripts are most recent and annotated. The scripts do the following
- **msd_ndof_data_generation.py** generates the dataset with the system description in the systems folder with flags determining what system data is generated for
- **msd_ndof_deepSI_encoder.py** estimates a black box deepSI encoder
- **msd_ndof_interconnect_fit.py** estimates the variety of different model augmentation structures with fags determining which model augmentation is trained from which dataset
- **msd_ndof_evaluate_fit_system.py** evaluate the RMSE and NRMSE scores of the models specified by the flags and returns their loss function curves
- **msd_ndof_state_comparison.py** compares the total model state with the augmentation on those states for select models as specified by the flags
